# What we are building

We are building Know How Soluciones Agricolas' website — a **modern, mobile-first, one-page landing page** for their avocado agricultural solutions.

## Sections

1. **Hero** — Company name, tagline, call-to-action button, and contact info button.
2. **About** — Why they are the best at what they do, with key differentiators.
3. **Certifications** — Logos and short descriptions for Metrocert, Mayacert, CAAE, SIAR, CERTIMEX, Primus.
4. **Contact Form** — Basic form for inquiries (name, email, message).

## Design & Tech

- Built with **Astro latest** + **TailwindCSS v4**.
- Tailwind breakpoints for responsive design.
- Color palette inspired by agriculture/avocado (greens, earthy tones).
- Smooth scroll navigation for in-page links.
- Fully responsive: optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Development

- Each section in a separate `.astro` component **only when it improves maintainability** — avoid over-componentization.
- Follow clean code principles: meaningful naming, clear structure, minimal repetition.
- Assets optimized for web (compressed images, SVGs where possible).
- No extra JS frameworks — Astro + Tailwind only.
